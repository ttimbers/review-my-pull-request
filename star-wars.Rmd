## Most accomplished

Below we look at which 5 characters from Star Wars are the most accomplished pilot (flew the fewest number of starships):

```{r}
kable(starwars %>% 
  unnest(films) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(10),
  col.names = c("Character", "Number of Starships piloted"))
```

By far, the most accomplished pilot of all is R2-D2. He is shown below piloting a starship.

```{r top-pilot, fig.cap="Most accomplished Star Wars pilot.", out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://starwarz.com/tbone/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/331.jpg",
                 )
```
